 * trip during which the thread can be closed, start a turn, or move to another
 * provider, account or working copy. None of those should have their content
 * overwritten, and the directory matters beyond that: the conversation was
 * listed for `cwd`, and Claude drops a resume binding whose directory is not
 * the one the next turn runs in, so a thread that has since moved would start
 * a new conversation rather than continue the chosen one.
 *
 * `busy` alone cannot see that, because it reports the current state rather
 * than whether anything happened: a turn that both starts and finishes inside
 * one of those round trips reads exactly like a thread that was never busy, and
 * replacing the transcript would throw the finished turn away. The turn
 * generation moves on every turn that starts, so a turn that ran and settled
 * leaves it ahead of where it was when the conversation was picked.
